      <h2>How it Started...</h2>
    
      <p>Please Buy My Pens (PBMP) began as a small, and I mean a very small business where I was going broke and needed money fast. So, I came up with this side hustle of selling pens. Since then, PBMP has sold a total of 3 pens.
    Scroll down for more epic information that is 100% worth your time (no promises). Please do consider buying them. They're... decent quality. </p>

        <img class="bluepenimg" src="images/wowverycoolpen.jpg" alt="bluepen"/>
       <p> Blue pens are a classic. Everybody loves them and uses them. You can go right with a trusty blue pen. This blue pen is 100% manufactured by me and not anybody else. </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Doesn’t smear ink anywhere</li>
      <li>Built like a cylinder and it’s kind of an awkward shape to hold and write with</li>
      <li>Can slip out of your hands</li>
      <li>Ink lasts for what seems like forever</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="bluepenbutton">

        <h3>Black Pens</h3>
      <img class="blackpenimg" src="images/blackpen.jpg" alt="blackpen"/>
      <p>Black pens are also a classic. Many people prefer color though, but that’s not a necessity. The black pens work just as good.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Write very smoothly</li>
      <li>Ink flows like water out of the pen</li>
      <li>Sometimes ink smudges on paper and hands</li>
      <li>Ink can run out fast</li>
      <li>Small grip on pen so your hand doesn't slip</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Red Pens</h3>
      <img class="redpenimg" src="images/redpen.jpg" alt="redpen"/>
      <p>Nobody uses red pens anymore. The last time I remember somebody using them was my teacher when she marked about 3/4th’s of my math exam that I failed. But you know what can get you into red pens? This one specifically!</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Ink runs smoothly</li>
      <li>Small grip on pen with even fancier lines so your hand doesn’t slip </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Pricing Information</h2>
        <p>Please note, red pens are cheaper because I haven’t seen anybody ever use them. I figured they must be unlikable. All prices are in Canadian dollars. Convert the money yourself.</p>

        <p>This one time, I needed pens so badly to write a story. I came across this extremely sketchy website that was selling pens for cheap. I figured it had to be a scam but it wasn’t! I actually had gotten my pens! I was able to write my story, which turned out to be a New York Times Bestseller. I cannot thank these pens enough! </p>

        <p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars!</p>

          <p>I use the red pen all the time! The quality is outstanding, and the ink never runs out. I feel like I can use it for days on end! It’s super smooth when I write a huge “X” on my student’s math problems that they always get wrong because I’m super tough on them for no reason! It’s perfect. I love seeing their faces when they see the bold, big, red X. I think they get excited about the pens too!</p>

            <p>If I’m being honest, I’m just the friend of the person who runs this business and they begged me to write a review. I didn’t even buy a pen but they said to pretend like I did. Keep in mind, I’m not getting paid for this. I think my friend, the owner of this business, is going crazy. But she’s really nice, so for promotion, you guys should seriously check out her pens! I heard they run smoothly and the other 2 reviews think the same too!</p>
