        <h2>How it Started...</h2>
        <p>Please Buy My Pens (PBMP) began as a small, and I mean a very small business where I was going broke and needed money fast. So, I came up with this side hustle of selling pens. Since then, PBMP has sold a total of 3 pens. Don’t let that number fool you, I plan to sell more. And what better way to sell them than on this website! Are the pens mine? Don't worry about that! That doesn’t matter when you need a pen to write with. You need one, I got one. 
      Scroll down for more epic information that is 100% worth your time (no promises). Please do consider buying them. They're... decent quality. </p>

      <h3>Blue Pens</h3>

      <img class="bluepenimg" src="images/wowverycoolpen.jpg" alt="bluepen"/>

      <p> Blue pens are a classic. Everybody loves them and uses them. You can go right with a trusty blue pen. This blue pen is 100% manufactured by me and not anybody else. </p>

      <ul>
      <li>Doesn’t smear ink anywhere</li>
      <li>Built like a cylinder and it’s kind of an awkward shape to hold and write with</li>
      <li>Can slip out of your hands</li>
      <li>Ink lasts for what seems like forever</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Black Pens</h3>

      <img class="blackpenimg" src="images/blackpen.jpg" alt="blackpen"/>

      <p>Black pens are also a classic. Many people prefer color though, but that’s not a necessity. The black pens work just as good.</p>
                              
        <ul>
        <li>Write very smoothly</li>
        <li>Ink flows like water out of the pen</li>
        <li>Sometimes ink smudges on paper and hands</li>
        <li>Ink can run out fast</li>
        <li>Small grip on pen so your hand doesn't slip</li>
        </ul>
